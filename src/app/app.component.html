<h2>1. Interpolation</h2>

<!-- Exercise 1.1 -->
<h3>Excercise 1.1</h3>
<p>
	The component contains a property storing the name of the currently logged in
	user.
</p>
<code>currentUser:String = "Mr. Pink"</code>
<p>
	Show the current value of the variable below by using interpolation.
</p>

<!-- Insert Answer for Exercise 1.1 -->
<div class="exercise">
	The current user is:
	<!---Username Here-->
</div>

<!-- Exercise 1.2 -->
<h3>Exercise 1.2</h3>
<p>In the compoent, a variable <code>countInBasket</code> is set. A method <code>getStock()</code> which returns the
	count of items in stock is also available.</p>
<p>Use expressions to display the items remaining in stock, if all items in the basket were to be purchased.</p>

<!-- Insert Answer for Exercise 1.2 -->
<div class="exercise">
	Items in stock after purchase:
	<!---Remaining Stock Here-->
</div>



<!-- Exercise 1.3 -->
<h3>Exercise 1.3</h3>
<p>To show how Angular automatically updates the view, if any values used in expressions change, we added a
	<code>now</code> variable, that contains the current date and time and is uptaded every second. Use interpolations
	to show the current date and time and watch as it updates every second.</p>
<!-- Insert Answer for Exercise 1.3 -->
<div class="exercise">
	Current date and time:
	<!---Current Date and Time Here-->
</div>

<!-- Section 2 -->

<h2>2. Property Binding</h2>

<h3>Exercise 2.1</h3>
<p>We have an <code>image</code> object, that contains a <code>title</code> and <code>url</code> property. Change the
	below code to display the image from the url dynamically using property binding. </p>

<div class="exercise">
	Image Title: {{image.title}}
	<!-- Uncomment the row below and add the "src" attribute with property binding to  the image.url variable -->
	<!-- <img /> -->
</div>

<h2>Exercise 2.2</h2>
<p>For this exercise we have an array with offers (<code>offers</code>). Some of the offers in this array are special
	offers and as such marked by an attribute <code>specialOffer = true</code>. For special offers a css class was
	created, that marks special offers in orange. Use property binding to bind the class <code>special-offer</code> to
	each of the offer elements, if relevant.</p>

<div class="exercise">
	<!-- Exercise 2.2 Add Property binding to class.special-offer to each of the divs below.-->
	<h4>Current Offers:</h4>
	<div>{{offers[0].name}}</div>
	<div>{{offers[1].name}}</div>
	<div>{{offers[2].name}}</div>
	<div>{{offers[3].name}}</div>
	<div>{{offers[4].name}}</div>
</div>

<h3>Exercise 2.3</h3>
<p>In this exercise we want to try out passing a variable to a custom component. This app already contains the
	<code>hello.component.ts</code>. Enable property binding for the <code>name</code> property in the custom component.
	Then show the component in the space below and pass the <code>myName</code> property from the
	<code>app.component</code> to it.</p>

<div class="exercise">
	<!-- Show the hello component and pass the myName variable. -->
	Hello:
</div>



<!-- Section 3 -->
<h2>3. Event Binding</h2>

<h3>Exercise 3.1</h3>

<p>In this exercise we want to bind the <code>onClick()</code> function to the <code>click</code> event on a button.
	This will trigger it any time the button is clicked.</p>

<div class="exercise">
	<!-- Show the hello component and pass the myName variable. -->
	<button>Click me!</button>
</div>





<!-- Section 4 -->
<h2>4. Structural Directives</h2>
<h3>Exercise 4.1 - NgIf</h3>

<p>In this example we are given a button, which toggles a property <code>showDetails</code></p>
<button (click)="showDetails=!showDetails">Toggle details</button>

<p>Feel free to try it out. The result should be shown here: showDetails = {{showDetails}}</p>

<div class="exercise">
	<!-- Allow users to toggle the following paragraph using *ngIf  -->
	<p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
		I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of
		the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had
		such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of
		the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing
		he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his
		apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others from
		death, but not himself.
	</p>
</div>


<h3>Exercise 4.2 - NgFor</h3>

<p>We reuse the array of offers from Exercise 2 (<code>offers</code>). Below you can find an unordered list
	(<code>ul</code>). It currently contains a list item (<code>li</code>) with the first item (<code>[0]</code>) from
	the array. Use ngFor to iterate this list item for every offer in the array.</p>

<div class="exercise">
	<!-- Exercise 2.2 Add Property binding to class.special-offer to each of the divs below.-->
	<h4>Current Offers:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>{{offers[0].name}}: {{offers[0].specialOffer}}</li>
	</ul>

</div>



<!-- Section 4 -->
<h2>5. Pipes</h2>
<h3>Exercise 5.1 - Built-in pipes</h3>

<p>In this example we are going to use a few built-in pipes to modify how some values are rendered in the DOM. In
	exercise 1.3 you used expressions to show the variable <code>now</code>. Here we ask you to again use an expression,
	but this time to combine the variable with a the date pipe to show three alternative views of the variable:</p>
<!-- <ul>
  <li>formatted date according to locale (pipe without parameters)</li>
  <li>the weekday of the date</li>

</ul> -->


<div class="exercise">
	<!-- Allow users to toggle the following paragraph using *ngIf  -->
	{{now | date}}
</div>


<h3>Exercise 4.2 - NgFor</h3>

<p>We reuse the array of offers from Exercise 2 (<code>offers</code>). Below you can find an unordered list
	(<code>ul</code>). It currently contains a list item (<code>li</code>) with the first item (<code>[0]</code>) from
	the array. Use ngFor to iterate this list item for every offer in the array.</p>

<div class="exercise">
	<!-- Exercise 2.2 Add Property binding to class.special-offer to each of the divs below.-->
	<h4>Current Offers:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>{{offers[0].name}}: {{offers[0].specialOffer}}</li>
	</ul>

</div>
